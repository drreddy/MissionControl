Development of advanced mobile satellite communications technology possessing reproduction relay and inter-beam connection functions by employing K-bands and miliband frequencies. The COMETS was launched by its 5th H-II Launch Vehicle on February 21, 1998 (JST). Though the first burnig was normal, the second burning time period of the second-stage engine was shorter than scheduled which resulted in injection of the COMETS satellite to lower orbit than the geostationary transfer orbit. Due to successful seven orbital controls, COMETS has been moved to recurrent orbit. It was used for conducting scheduled experiments on the orbit as possible.

Mission demonstration test satellites obtain basic data and allow scientists to test the functioning of various devices on actual satellites before those devices are deployed in higher-risk and more challenging missions. To shorten the development period and lower costs, these test satellites carry both newly developed equipment and devices with a known track record. These satellites also allow the use of increasingly complex commercially manufactured parts for space development, helping develop an industry that will lead to spacecraft with higher performance, lower costs, and smaller and lighter components. Furthermore, the use of commercial components means a shorter development period. The satellite bus system, the mission equipment, the tracking and control system, and the experiment-evaluation system have been integrated into one system in the development of TSUBASA.",

Midori II was launched by the H-IIA launch vehicle in December 14, 2002. Midori II has been engaged in various observation missions to understand the realities and causes of global environmental changes, such as abnormal weather conditions and the expansion of the ozone hole.?The combination of various sensor technologies allow the satellite to detect different electromagnetic waves reflected or emitted from plants, water and the atmosphere, enabling more precise observation of the Earth. Midori II is equipped with two sensors: the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR), which, day and night, can observe geographical parameters related to water; and the Global Imager (GLI), which can extensively and accurately observe oceans, land and clouds. The Global Imager is said to have attained the world’s highest standards in this field, in that it can observe the reflected solar radiation from the Earth’s surface, in order to understand the distribution of sea-surface temperature, snow, ice, cloud cover, aerosol, forest, sea phytoplankton, etc. Other devices on Midori II include the Improved Limb Atmospheric Spectrometer-II (ILAS-II), Sea Winds, the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth’s Reflectance (POLDER), and the Data Collection System (DCS). After an anomaly was detected in the \"Midori-II\" satellite on October 25, 2003, JAXA found that the possibility of restoring operations of the Midori-II was extremely slim as a result of its investigation, analysis, and inability to re-establish any communication with the satellite as of Oct. 31, 2003.",

It is a unique in that it is \"handmade\" - fabricated mainly by young JAXA engineers. The project’s aim was to foster innovation among young engineers and enable them to learn technologies to design, assemble, and test satellites. Their team performed almost all of the development and operation of the satellite, and all of the installed software was developed by JAXA. Furthermore, with a view to being able to use commercial, off-the-shelf components in the future, JAXA has had devices of its own design manufactured by specialized private-sector companies. This project also serves as a test case for the production of small satellites more efficiently and at reduced cost. With this program, Japan has taken another step forward in the field of space technology. After three and half years of operation, which was longer than its scheduled mission period, radio frequency links were terminated on September 27, 2006, to complete its mission operation. We will do our best to contribute to society by sharing our learning experience from the small satellite with the private sector.",

The major objectives of the mission are to understand the Moon’s origin and evolution, and to observe the moon in various ways in order to utilize it in the future. The lunar missions that have been conducted so far have gathered a large amount of information on the Moon, but the mysteries of its origin and evolution have been left unsolved. KAGUYA will investigate the entire moon in order to obtain information on its elemental and mineralogical composition, its geography, its surface and sub-surface structure, the remnant of its magnetic field, and its gravity field. The results are expected to lead to a better overall understanding of the Moon’s evolution. At the same time, the observation equipment installed on the orbiting satellite will observe plasma, the electromagnetic field and high-energy particles. The data obtained in this way will be of great scientific importance for exploring the possibility of using the moon for human endeavors.",
